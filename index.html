		<h3 class="title">What we have in Book Store?</h3>
		<p>Genre with socially-agreed-upon conventions developed over time. Genre is most popularly known as a category of literature, music, or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones.</p>
<p>Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.</p>

				<h4>Horror</h4>
				<p>Horror is a genre of speculative fiction which is intended to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle its readers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing".It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<i id="orangeBtn" class="fa fa-star-o"></i>
				<h4>Novel</h4>
				<p>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book.The entire genre has been seen as having "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years", with its origins in classical Greece and Rome, in medieval and early modern romance, and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella. (Since the 18th century, the term "novella", or "novelle" in German, has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long short story or a short novel).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<i id="yeallowBtn" class="fa fa-magic"></i>
				<h4>Fiction</h4>
				<p>Fiction broadly refers to any narrative that is derived from the imagination—in other words, not based strictly on history or fact. It can also refer, more narrowly, to narratives written only in prose (the novel and short story), and is often used as a synonym for the novel. In cinema it corresponds to narrative film in opposition to documentary as far as novel to feature film and short story to short film.  </p>
			</li>
				<li>
				<i id="pinkBtn" class="fa fa-heartbeat" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				<h4>Poetry</h4>
				<p>Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. </p>
			</li>
				<li>
				<i id="redBtn" class="fa fa-book"></i>
				<h4>History</h4>
				<p>History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation') is the study of the past as it is described in written documents.Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.</p>
			</li>
				<li>
				<i id="blueBtn"  class="fa fa-user"></i>
				<h4>Biography</h4>
				<p>A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>As books have now reached the 21st century with the creation of the increasingly popular e-book format, we thought it would be a good idea to take a look back at the long and involved history of the humble book.
        From the clay tablets to the e-book format, the book has enjoyed a remarkable evolution, presented here is a snapshot of that history: </p>
        <h4>3500 BC - Symbols onto Tablets</h4>
			<p>
The earliest surviving Papyrus scrolls that contain written words date back to around 2400 BC, originating in Egypt (The Fifth Dynasty of King Neferirkare Kakai), although it has suggested by historians that papyrus could have been used as early as the First Dynasty (3100 BC).

Papyrus is a very thick paper like material that is made from the "pith" (centre of the stem) of the papyrus plant, a reed like swamp plant that used to be found in abundance along the Nile river. This "pith" was cut into thin strips, pressed together and then glued and dried to form a thin flat surface that could be written on. Again a calamus cut from the stem of a reed and then sharpened was often used to scribe but bird feathers were also used.
